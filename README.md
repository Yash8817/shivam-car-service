Introduction:
In a world where global events like the pandemic have forced us to rethink traditional processes, I found myself drawn to a project that could address a real-world problem. The idea for a web-based vehicle repair and service management system came from a simple yet powerful concept: making life easier for vehicle owners while streamlining the operations of service centers.

I saw an opportunity to bridge the gap by creating a system where customers could book service appointments online, from the comfort of their homes. They wouldn’t need to physically visit the garage, wait in queues, or disrupt their daily routines. Instead, our system would take care of the logistics.

When a customer books an appointment, we pick up their vehicle, transport it to the service center, perform the necessary repairs and maintenance, and then return it safely to their doorstep. This not only minimizes physical contact but also optimizes the time and resources of both vehicle owners and service providers.

Project Overview:
Car service booking will be a website that provides a platform to book car services easily, keeping long waits out of the picture.
This website will allow customers to decide what type of car service they want to book, depending on the requirements and budget, they can book the car service they want.
All information related to vehicles and services will be maintained by admin, and customers will be able to see various services, prices, and details. customer can book an appointment.
This website uses the appointment tool that allows the customer to schedule an available appointment date and time.
OFFLINE PROCESS DESCRIPTION:
Current offline workflow of car service booking application
The current offline step-by-step process workflow.
LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING SYSTEM:

Existing systems may rely on phone calls or in-person appointments, making it inconvenient for customers to schedule service, especially during busy periods.
Customers often have limited visibility into the status of their vehicle during service, leading to uncertainty about progress and completion times.
The need for customers to physically visit service centers can be time-consuming and inconvenient, particularly for routine maintenance.
Inefficient scheduling and handling of vehicles can result in delays, impacting both customers and service providers.
Traditional systems may not effectively reach customers who prefer online services or those concerned about in-person interactions.
Handling and organizing service records and customer data manually can lead to errors, loss of information, and inefficiencies.
Overall, the existing system may not provide the level of convenience, transparency, and efficiency that modern customers expect in today’s digital age.
DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM:

Technology used to develope the application
List of mainly used tools and technology to complete the project
Implementation Details:
Let’s delve into some implementation details for the system. While it’s a complex project, I’ll provide an overview of the key components and steps involved. Depending on the project’s scope may need to go into more detail for each section.

PROPOSED SYSTEM:

The proposed system is categorized into five actors:

Admin
Attendee
Mechanic
Customer
Visitor
ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM:


The database design shows the database tables and the data dictionary for the table and the relationship between the tables.
USE-CASE DIAGRAM:


This represents what each user component will able to perform in the application and how users interact with the application.
USER FLOW AND SCREENSHOT OF APPLICATION:
In the following sections, you’ll find a visual walkthrough of a web application, providing a look at what each user will encounter during their journey. An overview of the user experience allows one to gain an understanding of the application’s functionality and how it benefits both customers and service providers.

Admin panel walkthrough
admin login
Login screen for all the user’s
Dashboard

Admin dashboard gives the overview of the application where he gets the details of the current system data
Attendee, is person who is responsible to approve or reject the user’s appointment

Attendee vise appointment View

Admin can view the attendee vise appointment
Manage services module

Manage the service section where he views the service

Admin can add the new service

Update service screen
Manage parts module

view parts present inside the system

Add new part screen
Manage offer module

Admin can also add offers

Updating the existing offers
Manage manage membership

admin can provide the membership

Admin can manage staff in the application
Manage vehicle module

Admin can manage the vehicle and its type
2. User walkthrough

Homepage of application

Front-end of the application
Purchase Membership section

User can purchase the memberships if they want
Profile section

Manage provide where user can update personal details such as contact details and password
My Appointment section

User can view and manage the previous appointment
Manage Membership section

User has access to take new membership or cancel the existing one
Manage Vehicle section

One user can have multiple vehicles added into the application
View History

After completion of the service his details will come into history section
3. Booking Appointment


Booking new appointment from the user screen
4. Attendee Screen

View new appointment

Once the appointment is booked, attendee will come and view the request present inside the application
Accept or Reject the Appointment

Attendee can accept the appointment or reject the appointment based on the current availability
Creates a job card
A job card is a record of a vehicle’s service history. It contains details about the vehicle, such as the registration number, VIN, and engine number. It also includes the date the vehicle was serviced, the mechanic who performed the work, and the date the work was completed.


Once the appointment is approved, the attendee can create the job card for the appointment
Payment collection by attendee

Attendee can accept the payment, as of now payment mode is cash, later online payment module will added to the application
Bill to the user

This is the overview of the bill that user will get after the payment is done
5. Overview of report section for admin


Admin car generate the report by selecting the range
